I am currently working as a research scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway), having obtained my PhD degree in Chemistry from the University of Edinburgh. My PhD was fully funded by two university scholarships awarded to international students. Prior to my time at Edinburgh, I obtained my MPhil in Chemistry from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, also fully funded by scholarships.

My research at MET Norway focuses on developing emission profiles and chemical mechanisms for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and comparing model outputs with European measurements. The purpose is to study the linkages between anthropogenic emissions and VOCs concentrations, and to investigate the roles of individual VOCs in surface ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation, as well as strategies for their mitigation.

My doctoral research centred on simulating atmospheric reactive N and S species and their mitigation at global and regional scales. By validating against measurements from different air quality monitoring networks worldwide, my work bolstered the EMEP-WRF modelling system's credibility for global budget analyses and for investigation of the effectiveness of different N and S emission control strategies. As a result of this research, I have three first-author publications in Atmos. Chem. Phys. and Geosci. Model Dev. For more detailed information, please refer to my Publication page.

My MPhil research created an innovative coupling of aerosol carbon and chemiluminescent NOx analysers capable of distinguishing between organic and inorganic nitrogen-containing species in aerosols. This work led to a co-authored paper in Environ. Sci. Technol. Additionally, I contributed to research on the kinetics of the production of inorganic sulfur species from the heterogeneous OH oxidation of organosulfates, a study that also yielded a co-authored publication in ACS Earth Space Chem.

I firmly believe that the best way to enhance our understanding of the atmosphere is by combining state-of-the-art models with state-of-the-art measurements. My long-term goal is to utilise both atmospheric models and real-world measurements to address scientific questions and provide advice to policy makers on how to tackle air pollution and climate change problems.
