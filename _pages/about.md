I am currently a Research Associate in the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, working with Professor Alex Archibald. In October 2024, I was elected to a Postdoctoral Research Associate position at Pembroke College.

My current research focuses on improving the representation of global marine sulfur cycle in climate models, utilising the <a href="https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA">UK Chemistry and Aerosol model (UKCA)</a> and the <a href="https://ukesm.ac.uk/">UK Earth System Model (UKESM)</a>. Before joining Cambridge, I have more than four yearsâ€™ experience in global and regional atmospheric modelling using the <a href="https://emep.int/mscw/">EMEP atmospheric chemistry and transport model</a> driven by WRF or ECMWF meteorology. 

To date, I have published seven papers in high-IF journals. These include four first-author publications from my PhD research in Edinburgh and my work at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (aka Norwegian Met Office/MET Norway); and three co-authored publications stemming from my MPhil and other postdoctoral research. For detailed information, please refer to my Publication page.

I firmly believe that the best way to enhance our understanding of the atmosphere is by combining state-of-the-art models with state-of-the-art measurements. My long-term goal is to utilise both atmospheric models and real-world measurements to address scientific questions and provide advice to policy makers on how to tackle air pollution and climate change.
