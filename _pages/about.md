I am currently working as an air quality modeller at UKCEH, previously serving as a research scientist and model developer at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway). I have a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Edinburgh, funded entirely by two university scholarships designated for international students.

I have more than four yearsâ€™ experience in global and regional atmospheric modelling using the <a href="https://emep.int/mscw/">EMEP atmospheric chemistry and transport model</a>  driven by WRF or ECMWF meteorology. To date, I have published seven papers in high-IF journals. These include three first-author publications from my PhD research on global modelling of atmospheric reactive nitrogen and sulphur species and their mitigation strategies; one first-author paper in ACP Discussions arising from my work at MET Norway, where I developed emission profiles and chemical mechanisms for volatile organic compounds (VOCs); and three co-authored publications stemming from my MPhil and other postdoctoral research. For detailed information, please refer to my Publication page.

I firmly believe that the best way to enhance our understanding of the atmosphere is by combining state-of-the-art models with state-of-the-art measurements. My long-term goal is to utilise both atmospheric models and real-world measurements to address scientific questions and provide advice to policy makers on how to tackle air pollution and climate change problems.
