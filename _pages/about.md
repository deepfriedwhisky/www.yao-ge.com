I am currently working as a research scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, having obtained my PhD degree in Atmospheric Chemistry from the University of Edinburgh. My PhD was fully funded by two university scholarships awarded to international students: the Principal's Career Development Scholarship and the Edinburgh Global Research Scholarship. Prior to my time at Edinburgh, I earned an MPhil in Atmospheric Chemistry from the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, also fully funded by scholarships, and a BSc in Chemistry from the Ocean University of China.

My PhD research focused on global and regional atmospheric chemistry modelling of secondary inorganic aerosol, utilizing the EMEP MSC-W atmospheric chemistry and transport model (<a href="www.emep.int">www.emep.int</a>). This was a collaborative project between the Schools of Chemistry and GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH). Currently, my work at MET Norway involves developing chemistry mechanisms in the EMEP model to investigate the role of various anthropogenic volatile organic compounds in the formation of surface ozone and secondary organic aerosol, as well as strategies for their mitigation.

I firmly believe that the best way to enhance our understanding of the atmosphere is by combining state-of-the-art models with state-of-the-art measurements. My long-term goal is to utilize both atmospheric models and ambient measurements to address scientific questions and provide advice to policy makers on how to tackle air pollution and climate change problems.
