I am currently working as a research scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway), having obtained my PhD degree in Atmospheric Chemistry from the University of Edinburgh. My PhD was fully funded by two university scholarships awarded to international students: the Principal's Career Development Scholarship and the Edinburgh Global Research Scholarship. Prior to my time at Edinburgh, I obtained my MPhil in Atmospheric Chemistry from the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, also fully funded by scholarships, and my BSc in Chemistry from the Ocean University of China.

My research at MET Norway involves developing chemistry mechanisms (EmChem19) in the EMEP atmospheric chemistry and transport model (<a href="https://www.emep.int/mscw/index.html">https://www.emep.int/mscw/index.html</a>) to investigate the role of various anthropogenic volatile organic compounds in the formation of surface ozone and secondary organic aerosol, as well as strategies for their mitigation. As part of my work, I am also comparing model outputs from EmChem19 and CRI mechanisms with ambient measurements to identify potential problems in emissions and model parameterization, and ultimately improve the depiction of VOC chemistry in the model.

Previously, during my PhD research, I focused on global and regional atmospheric chemistry modelling of inorganic reactive N and S species, such as ammonia and ammonium, using the EMEP model. This collaborative project was conducted with the Schools of Chemistry and GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH). As a result of this research, I have published two papers and have one more currently under review. For more detailed information on these publications, please refer to my Publication page.
I firmly believe that the best way to enhance our understanding of the atmosphere is by combining state-of-the-art models with state-of-the-art measurements. My long-term goal is to utilize both atmospheric models and ambient measurements to address scientific questions and provide advice to policy makers on how to tackle air pollution and climate change problems.
