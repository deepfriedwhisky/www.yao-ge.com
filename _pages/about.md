I am currently working as a Research Associate at the Department of Chemistry in the University of Cambridge with Prof Alex Archibald. I have a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Edinburgh (UoE), fully funded by two UoE’s  scholarships designated for international students.

My current research focuses on constraining the role of global marine sulfur cycle in the Earth System, utilising the <a href="https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA">UK Chemistry and Aerosol model (UKCA)</a> and the <a href="https://ukesm.ac.uk/">UK Earth System Model (UKESM)</a>. Before joining Cambridge, I have more than four years’ experience in global and regional atmospheric modelling using the <a href="https://emep.int/mscw/">EMEP atmospheric chemistry and transport model</a> driven by WRF or ECMWF meteorology. 

To date, I have published seven papers in high-IF journals. These include four first-author publications from my PhD research in Edinburgh and my work at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (i.e., Norwegian Met Office); and three co-authored publications stemming from my MPhil and other postdoctoral research. For detailed information, please refer to my Publication page.

I firmly believe that the best way to enhance our understanding of the atmosphere is by combining state-of-the-art models with state-of-the-art measurements. My long-term goal is to utilise both atmospheric models and real-world measurements to address scientific questions and provide advice to policy makers on how to tackle air pollution and climate change problems.
