Hello World! This is Yao Ge's Personal Website.

I am currently working as a research scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute after obtaining my PhD degree in Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. My PhD is fully funded by two scholarships awarded to international students: the Principalâ€™s Career Development and Edinburgh Global Research Scholarships. Before coming to Edinburgh, I obtained my MPhil in Atmospheric Chemistry with a GPA of 4.075/4.3 from Hong Kong University of Science & Technology and my BSc in Chemistry with a GPA of 3.64/4.0 from Ocean University of China.
