Since arriving in Scotland, I have taken up hiking because the country has many outstanding mountains to offer. Hiking is an excellent way to get out of the city and connect with nature, allowing me to appreciate beautiful scenery, breathe fresh air, and enjoy peaceful surroundings. In particular, Munro-bagging provides a sense of challenge and accomplishment as I set goals, push myself, and reach new heights.

After completing my PhD, I moved to Norway for my new job and discovered cross-country skiing, which I find both thrilling and adventurous despite the occasional falls and being buried by snow ðŸ¤£. It is also a fantastic full-body workout that engages muscles in the legs, arms, and core, improving my cardiovascular fitness and endurance. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of winter landscapes, which can be a great stress reliever.

Besides these outdoor activities, I'm also passionate about cooking and baking. I love researching new recipes and trying them out, paying close attention to detail and appreciating the cultural and scientific aspects of different cuisines. Moreover, I am a very social person and use baking as an opportunity to spend time with friends and family, creating a warm and welcoming environment that brings people together.
