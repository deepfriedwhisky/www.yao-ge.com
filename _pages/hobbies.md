Since arriving in Scotland, I have taken up hiking because the country has many outstanding mountains to offer. In particular, Corbett & Munro bagging provides a sense of challenge and accomplishment as I set goals, push myself, and reach new heights.

I fell in love with cross-country skiing after moving to Norway, which I find both thrilling and adventurous despite the numerous falls and being buried by snow. It provides an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of Norwegian winter landscapes, which can be a great stress reliever.

Besides these outdoor activities, I'm also passionate about cooking and baking. I love researching new recipes and trying them out, as well as appreciating the cultural values of different cuisines. I am a very social person and regard cooking & baking as an opportunity to spend quality time with friends and family. It's a way to create a warm and inviting atmosphere that brings people together.
